The 66-year-old singer , whose hits include To All The Girls I &apos;ve Loved Before , announced the marriage in a statement to Spanish newspapers . The ceremony , held in Marbella , was attended by two witnesses and the couple &apos;s five children .

The Rev Roberto Rojo Aguado told the Associated Press news agency the couple were married on Tuesday .
Transport Minister Juan Molinar said the airline &apos;s operations would &quot; definitively cease &quot; by noon on Saturday local time ( 1700 GMT ) . The action will also apply to two budget carriers affiliated with Mexicana - Link and Click . Mexicana had already axed some of its routes and had stopped selling tickets . The airline flew 220 routes to 65 destinations including London , Madrid , Montreal , Chicago and cities in Central and South America . The 89-year-old airline has debts of about $ 800m ( Â £ 500m ) . It filed for bankruptcy protection after failing to reach a deal with trade unions on cost-cutting . Plans to sack about 1,000 flight attendants to enable a takeover by a Mexican investment group were blocked by the government earlier this week . The firm suffered heavy losses during Mexico &apos;s recession in 2009 , as well during an outbreak of swine flu the same year . The flu outbreak caused a sharp fall in tourism in the country . After filing for bankruptcy protection Mexicana proposed deep pay cuts for pilots and crew , as well as a 40 % reduction in the workforce .
