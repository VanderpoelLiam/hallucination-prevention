Imran Yusuf must be the har@@ de@@ st-@@ working comedian in Edinburgh .
The circulation of every regional daily newspaper in Wales has fallen , with the country &apos;s flagship title the Western Mail dipping below the 30,000 mark .
The dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago by at least two space impacts , rather than a single strike , a new study suggests .
The Taliban have revealed the base from which they planned to shoot down the prime minister &apos;s helicopter during his first visit to Afghanistan in June .
During his 25 days on the Fringe he has tot@@ ted up more than 100 shows . But the 30-year-old Londoner &apos;s lab@@ ours have certainly started to bear fruit . Yusuf is the first act from the &quot; free fringe &quot; scene to be nominated for the Foster &apos;s Edinburgh Comedy Awards . He is up for the best newcomer award despite appearing as part of the Laugh@@ ing Horse Free Festival , where the acts perform for free with the prospect of a contribution from an appreciative crowd . Yusuf is also the only Muslim comedian to be nominated . He is currently observing Ramadan so he is fasting during the day despite his punishing schedule . As well as his own show , he com@@ per@@ es a Laugh@@ ing Horse show each night at 11.@@ 30pm and takes every open mic and guest spot possible . &quot; Hard work is the only way to greatness , &quot; he says . And hard work has helped him overcome the perceived obstacle of performing at a free venue . &quot; It just goes to show , &quot; he says . &quot; Even if you don &apos;t have the profile or the budget or the right people in the right places , if you have a dream and you follow it through with passion and hard work , you can get this far . &quot; Yusuf &apos;s breakthrough has been an &quot; arduous journey &quot; though . His first foray into comedy ended in &quot; personal depression &quot; and 18 months away from the circuit . He returned three years ago with a desire to &quot; attack &quot; the comedy scene . Yusuf draws inspiration from US comedian Chris Rock who said the route to success was to &quot; gig , gig , gig . &quot; According to Yusuf , Rock is &quot; not only a great comedian but also a spokesperson for some of the issues which don &apos;t get tackled successfully . &quot; These are issues of race and religion and &quot; contri@@ ved &quot; cultural differences which divide people , he says . Yusuf says he wanted to build bridges and connect people . He says he has a &quot; strong spiritual foundation &quot; and is happy to have grown up in a culture which &quot; inspired me for all the right reasons . &quot; However , he does admit he has always been the od@@ d-@@ one-@@ out . In a massive extended family everyone else is a &quot; number@@ -@@ crun@@ cher . &quot; Yusuf , the youngest of three brothers who grew up in Hackney and Harrow , has always been the &quot; maverick . &quot; This made it easier for his parents to accept his unusual career path . &quot; If I was doing this and not being successful it might be more of a problem , &quot; he says . Yusuf , who is set to appear in the next series of Michael McIntyre &apos;s Comedy Roadshow on TV , said his recent success had blown his mind . He said : &quot; I am hoping tomorrow I get the phone call that I &apos;m going to be in a movie with Jackie Chan . Then I can retire . &quot; A future movie deal seems a possibility but for Yusuf to stop working seems very unlikely .
The figures , which reveal the number of copies distributed on an average day for the first half of 2010 , have led to concern about the future of the industry in Wales . Media lecturer James Stewart said it was worrying for Welsh democracy . The Western Mail said its circulation trend was &quot; improving slightly . &quot; Newspapers across the UK have seen the number of copies sold and read continuously fall over recent years . The latest figures show that only one of the UK &apos;s 86 regional daily newspapers increased its sales year-on-year in the first half of 2010 - the DC Thom@@ son-@@ owned Dundee Evening Telegraph . Of the Welsh titles , the Western Mail - the only daily that covers the whole of Wales - saw the biggest drop in circulation during the first half of 2010 compared with the same period last year , down 10.@@ 2 % . Its average daily circulation was 29@@ ,5@@ 67 . The Daily Post , which covers north Wales , had the smallest year-on-year decline in circulation at -@@ 4.5 % , with an average daily circulation figure higher than the Western Mail at 3@@ 2,4@@ 14 . The newspaper with the highest circulation figure was the South Wales Evening Post , which covers the Swansea area , with an average figure of 4@@ 2,6@@ 19 . James Stewart , who worked at the Western Mail and South Wales Echo in the late 1970s and early 80s and is now senior lecturer in journalism at the University of Glamorgan , said the figures were &quot; sad and worrying . &quot; He said when he worked at the Western Mail , its circulation figure was around 90,000 , adding there were serious implications about its decline over the last 30 years . &quot; As we &apos;re coming up to a referendum next year on more powers for the Welsh assembly , how many people in Wales are watching Welsh news or reading papers that discuss these things ? Most people are not , &quot; he said . &quot; In evidence given to the assembly &apos;s culture committee recently , which was looking into public service broadcasting , it emerged 90 % of people in Wales read a paper that doesn &apos;t contain Welsh news . &quot; That &apos;s very worrying if you want an electorate who knows what &apos;s going on and is engaged in the democratic process . &quot; He added : &quot; What are their other sources of information ? There &apos;s the BBC - but how many young people watch local news on television or listen to it on the radio ? There have also been major questions about the news resources at ITV Wales . &quot; Mr Stewart , who also previously worked at BBC Wales , said he believed that many young people did not read newspapers and were more likely to go online , while even the habits of traditional readers were changing . &quot; You have to ask what the difference was 30 years ago , &quot; he said . &quot; The number of journalists at the Western Mail has gone down . The quality of their journalism is still very good but they just haven &apos;t got the resources they used to have . &quot; It &apos;s sad but on the other hand , as someone now involved in education , it &apos;s interesting to look at where journalism will now go . How will people be informed ? We have to look at how that will be done . &quot; He added that it was too soon to say whether newspaper companies would be able to make their websites work , as they currently do not get as much advertising revenue from them as they do from newspapers . Alan Edmunds , publishing director at Media Wales - home to the Western Mail and the South Wales Echo - said the company &apos;s website was helping them reach a &quot; large audience . &quot; &quot; Despite the obvious challenging circulation environment there has been a slight improvement in the circulation trend for both the South Wales Echo and the Western Mail as a result of a number of editorial and publishing enh@@ ancements , &quot; he said . &quot; For example , we &apos;re planning to launch the second phase of the South Wales Echo &apos;s redesign in September and this will be backed up by a number of newspaper sales initiatives . &quot; Following a redesign in June , the Western Mail has continued to focus on serving its key business and political audiences in print and through the large audience we reach through Wal@@ es@@ Online . &quot; Rob Irvine , publishing director at Trinity Mirror North Wales , which publishes the Daily Post , said it too had seen a rise in people using its website . &quot; We &apos;ve seen an improvement to the circulation trend for the Daily Post which is encouraging in the current challenging environment and we &apos;re delighted with a significant increase to our unique user numbers for d@@ ail@@ y@@ post@@ .co.uk , up 28 % period on period and 43 % year on year , &quot; he said . &quot; The Daily Post remains focused on serving our audiences and advertisers across print , online and mobile . &quot; The South Wales Evening Post and the Leader have been asked to comment , while the South Wales Ar@@ gus did not want to comment .
Previously , scientists had identified a huge impact crater in the Gulf of Mexico as the event that spelled doom for the dinosaurs . Now evidence for a second impact in Ukraine has been uncovered . This raises the possibility that the Earth may have been bombarded by a whole shower of space rocks . The new findings are published in the journal Ge@@ ology by a team lead by Professor David Jol@@ ley of Aberdeen University , UK . When first proposed in 1980 , the idea that an asteroid or comet impact had killed off the dinosaurs proved hugely controversial . Later , the discovery of the Chic@@ x@@ ul@@ ub Cr@@ ater in the Gulf of Mexico was hailed as &quot; the smoking gun &quot; that confirmed the theory . Double trouble The discovery of a second impact crater suggests that the dinosaurs were driven to extinction by a &quot; double w@@ hammy &quot; rather than a single strike . The Bol@@ ty@@ sh Cr@@ ater in Ukraine was first reported in 2002 . However , until now it was uncertain exactly how the timing of this event related to the Chic@@ x@@ ul@@ ub impact . In the current study , scientists examined the &quot; pollen and sp@@ ores &quot; of fossil plants in the layers of mud that inf@@ illed the crater . They found that immediately after the impact , fer@@ ns quickly colon@@ ised the devastated landscape . Fer@@ ns have an amazing ability to bounce back after catastrophe . Lay@@ ers full of fer@@ n sp@@ ores - dubbed &quot; fer@@ n spikes &quot; - are considered to be a good &quot; markers &quot; of past impact events . However , there was an unexpected discovery in store for the scientists . They located a second &quot; fer@@ n spike &quot; in a layer one metre above the first , suggesting another later impact event . Professor Simon Kel@@ ley of the Open University , UK , who was co-author on the study , said : &quot; We interpret this second layer as the aftermath of the Chic@@ x@@ ul@@ ub impact . &quot; This shows that the Bol@@ ty@@ sh and Chic@@ x@@ ul@@ ub impacts did not happen at exactly the same time . They struck several thousand years apart , the length of time between the two &quot; fer@@ n spikes . &quot; Un@@ certain cause Professor Kel@@ ley continued : &quot; It is quite possible that in the future we will find evidence for more impact events . &quot; Rather than being wiped out by a single hit , the researchers think that dinosaurs may have fallen victim to a shower of space rocks raining down over thousands of years . What might have caused this bombardment is highly uncertain . Professor Monica Grady , a meteorite expert at the Open University who was not involved in the current study , said : &quot; One possibility might be the coll@@ ison of Near Earth Ob@@ jects . &quot; Recently , Nasa launched a program dubbed &quot; Space@@ guard . &quot; It aims to monitor such Near Earth Ob@@ jects as an early warning system of possible future coll@@ isons .
A Taliban spokesman told the BBC the attack would have been launched from a base in Wash@@ ir , north-west Helmand . David Cameron &apos;s plans were changed at the last minute when intercep@@ ts of Taliban radio messages showed that they knew which helicopter he was flying in . Downing Street said it did not comment on the prime minister &apos;s security plans . Number 10 is reported to be re@@ thinking scheduling and media plans for future visits to take the risks into account . BBC world affairs correspondent David Loy@@ n said any claims from the Taliban had to be be treated with extreme scepticism , especially coming two months after the diversion of the prime minister &apos;s flight . But , when contacted by the BBC , the Taliban spokesman Q@@ ari You@@ sef Ahmadi added one piece of information to what was already known - the location of the team planning to shoot the helicopter down . He said that the Taliban attack was to be launched from their base at Wash@@ ir , in the north-west of the main conflict zone in Helmand . He would not reveal the source of the Taliban &apos;s information about the flight , nor the weapons they were planning to use . Trip diverted Mr Cameron &apos;s location was known because , unusually , he had visited Kabul first , holding a media conference with Afghanistan &apos;s President Hamid Karzai , before going on to Helmand . He was forced to abandon a visit to British troops serving at the front-line patrol base at Shahzad because of the fears of a Taliban attack . The RAF Chin@@ ook carrying the prime minister and his entourage was instead diverted to the main operating base in the capital of Helmand , Lash@@ kar G@@ ah , at the last minute . A former British commander in Afghanistan , Colonel Richard Kemp , told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 : &quot; We sometimes underestimate the Taliban &apos;s sophistication ( and ) intelligence-@@ collection capability , and they are very , very good at it . &quot; The Taliban had &quot; sources in many places , &quot; he said , including within the Afghan security forces and &quot; even in military bases . &quot; But Col Kemp said it was important that people in Britain and Afghanistan were able to see the &quot; commitment &quot; of the prime minister , adding : &quot; You can &apos;t hide behind security to the exclusion of all else . He has to be out and about , he has to be seen . &quot; He suggested more attention , though , be given to the planning of future visits , with press conferences coming at the end of trips so as to minimise the amount of time available to the Taliban to plan any attack . He said : &quot; It &apos;s very important that we don &apos;t lose the prime minister . The massive victory that we hand to the Taliban by shooting his helicopter down , or even a near miss , would be very significant . &quot; BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said : &quot; There &apos;s no official comment from Downing Street , but it &apos;s clear they are taking the security warnings seriously and re@@ thinking the scheduling and media arrangements for future visits to take far greater account of the risks involved . &quot; Earlier this year , police concerns about Mr Cameron &apos;s security were reported over the prime minister &apos;s insistence on walking around Whitehall and refusing motorcycle escor@@ ts . In the past , visits to war zones by senior politicians and officials have often been subject to news blackouts until nearer the end of the trip , as was the case with the recent journey by Defence Secretary Liam Fox .
