Police , councils and the NHS recorded scores of missing items , including computers , mobile phones , Blackberries and USB data sticks . The call for action came from the Lib Dems who obtained the information . The Scottish government said public services were responsible for storing their own information . The Lib Dems said that between December last year and June , seven NHS areas recorded a range of missing equipment , including patient files and details of more than 100 people on a needle exchange programme . Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS board reported the theft of eight laptops , six hard drives and three PCs . This included two laptops stolen from the paediatrics department at Yorkhill Hospital in March of this year and a PC stolen from the X-ray viewing room at the Western Infirmary in April . Meanwhile , Strathclyde Police reported an unencrypted USB stick containing investigation files as missing . Lost or stolen equipment among local authorities included five laptops from a children and families establishment in Edinburgh which contained the details of 10 people . West Dunbartonshire Council also lost 60 personal computers from schools . Most equipment missing from councils was either encrypted or contained no personal details . Last January , the Lib Dems called for an urgent review into data loss after reporting that scores of laptops , PCs and memory sticks containing confidential data had been lost by councils and health boards in recent years . The party said that while almost all files were encrypted , the public would be rightly worried that their personal data was at risk . Lib Dem justice spokesman Robert Brown said : &quot; Central government , local councils , NHS boards and the police hold a great deal of information on all of us . Our data is in their hands and we need to know they are taking this responsibility seriously . &quot; The government is not in control of the situation . They need to get a grip on this right now . &quot; A Scottish government spokesman said it took data security &quot; very seriously &quot; and had set robust standards for the storage and transmission of data . He added : &quot; We expect the same high standards of public sector bodies . However , it remains the responsibility of individual police forces , local authorities and health boards to ensure that personal or sensitive information is stored securely . &quot;
